  notes: |
    Exercise with two people. One person is f(x) = 2x + 1 another is g(x) = 2x + y where y 
    is the last result from f(x). The audience's job is to guess the implementations by poking at the
    functions with inputs. The functions each take turns answering. The audience shouts "2!" and then
    f replies "5". The audience says "3?" and g replies "11!" (2*3 + 5). The goal is to demonstrate that
    side effects are hard.
